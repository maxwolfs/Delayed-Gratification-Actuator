> Because today's ultra-fast cycle rates being first above being right.
It tells us what's happening in real time, but rarely what it means.
Industrial design between extreme pain and pleasure, Asceticism and decadence.

## Backround & Concept

Digital Technology is developing faster and is more and more sucking us into a continuous on demand, flexible and dynamic
environment. Services and Products are delivered faster and Digital Content is almost accessible immediately.
Facebook Stream, Netflix, project based work, amazon prime just to name a few global services.
In times of [Sofortness](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofortness) the ability of self-control is becoming less
used but at the same time more important. What does this to us and our relation to things and how does the ubiquity of
digital services shape our expectations on  matter, material culture?

The Delayed Gratification Actuator acts is box that acts as a time capsule.
It is a monolithic product to examine the relation between things - especially their meaning - to their owners.
It consists of a dumb container to put things in and a smart lid with interface to set the date when the box will
open in the future. Once it’s closed the control Interface is locked within and the only remaining action from outside
is to press the top button to see how much time is left, until it will open. The aesthetics of the current prototype aim
to a monolithic, out of time object without any ornamental details to evoke a world of fantasy and fiction,
blurring distinctions between everyday life and the hyper-reality of adverstising and branding.

Normal Product Design has its emphasis on easy pleasure. Aesthetic Disturbance by Design.
This intended criticial design approach according to Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby reinforces the status quo.
Unfinished. Like a walkman offered different readings of familiar settings, a landscape. We are surrounded by products
that give us an illusion of choice and encourage passivity. Like [Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby](http://www.dunneandraby.co.uk/content/home) proposed:

> Electronic products and services could enrich and expand our experience of everyday life rather than closing it down;
they could become a medium for experiencing complex aesthetic situations.

The project tries to focus on how the psychological dimensions of experiences offered through electronic products
can be expanded. By referring to the world of product misuse and abuse, where desire overflows its material limits
and subverts the function of everyday objects, this product would address the darker, conceptual models of need that
are usually limited.

The user becomes a protagonist and the designer a co-author of the experience, the product creates dilemmas rather
than resolving them. By using the Delayed Gratification Actuator the owner explores boundaries between himself and the
paranoid user suggested by the product, entering into a psychlogical adventure.

The work is being developed in the course “Digital Artifactual Objections” under the guidance of Prof. Dennis P. Paul.

## Current State & Why does this Project need funding?

I have already invested about 500€ to get to the current state of prototype.
Even if it looks simple, the combination of technologies that are involved have required a deep research,
which is not finished yet. This includes the locking mechanism, the opening lift mechanism, the power supply,
circuit layout, the program on the technical side. Especially the locking mechanism with electromagnetic
solenoids must be improved as well as the push-push actuator design to lift the lid from container which
is currently more like a cool prototypic hack than a solid solution for frequent use.

## Aim & Outcome

With the HEC stipend I would be able to

1. resolve mechanical issues and produce a final prototype
2. produce a small batch for pilot testing
3. hand it to pilot testers and evaluate the user stories

The aim is to get to a small batch of five prototypes to distribute them to people for pilot testing.
For this I want to push to the current prototype to a level where all parts are finalized to iterate the
production of more units. With the test phase I want to examine the role of the users and the experience with the object.
What does it to them? Which Narratives are being developed?
How does the absence of specific material objects shape their relation to them?
