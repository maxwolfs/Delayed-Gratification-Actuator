## Backround

Because today's ultra-fast cycle rates being first above being right. It tells us what's happening in real time, but rarely what it means. Digital Technology is developing faster and is more and more sucking us into a continuous on demand, flexible and dynamic environment. Products and Things are delivered faster and Digital Content is almost accessible immediately. Facebook Stream, Netflix, project based work, amazon prime just to name a few. In times of Sofortness  the ability of self-control is becoming less used but at the same time more important.  What does this to us and our relation to things?

## Object

The Delayed Gratification Actuator acts as a time capsule. It tries to give a monolithic tool to examine the relation between things but especially their meaning to their owners. It consists of a ‘dumb’ container to put things in and a smart lid with interface to set the date when the box will open in the future. Once it’s closed the Interface is locked within and the only remaining Action from outside is to press the Top Button to see how much time is left it will open. The Design must be as meaningless as it’s possible to leave this space for the meaning of the things put into it. So the aesthetics of the current prototype aim to a monolithic, out of time object without any ornamental details.
