## Backround & Concept

> Because today's ultra-fast cycle rates being first above being right.
It tells us what's happening in real time, but rarely what it means.
Industrial design between extreme pain and pleasure, Asceticism and decadence.

Digital Technology is developing faster and is sucking us more and more into a continuous on demand, flexible and dynamic environment. Services and Products are delivered faster and Digital Content is almost accessible immediately. In times of Sofortness the ability of self-control is becoming less used but at the same time more important. How does this shape us and our relation to things and how does the ubiquity of digital services shape our expectations on  matter and material culture? The Delayed Gratification Actuator is a time capsule, exploring these boundaries between the user and the paranoid user suggested by the product, entering a psychlogical adventure by addressing the darker, conceptual models of need that are usually limited.
